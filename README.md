# Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide a professional and easily customizable Portfolio.

No need to know anything about web development, I explain everything to you ! :blush:

# How to install

First of all, download the project or clone it:
```
git clone https://github.com/MRK4/portfolio-builder.git
```

Une fois que c'est fait, afin de pouvoir voir Ã  quoi ressemble le site, ouvre un terminal dans le dossier racine du projet (/portfolio-builder) et faites:
```
npm run serve
```

Once this is done, open a new page in your browser and enter in the URL: `localhost:8080`.

Now you can see the website ! :tada:

# How to customize

I tagged all the possible customizable areas with the word "CUSTOMIZATION".

I will explain you step by step how to modify the components, but you can look for yourself by searching the word "CUSTOMISATION" in your IDE.

## Change your Name / Job / Details

Go to `src/components/Portfolio_Header.vue`.

From line `63` to `68`, you will be able the change the informations.

## Change your picture

Go to `src/assets/imgs`.

### Keep the .jpg extension

Simply replace the `avatar.jpg` by antoher JPG image of your choice.

### Choose another extension

Go to `src/assets/imgs` and put your image here.

Then go to `src/components/Portfolio_Header.vue`.

At line `9`, you will have:
```
<img class="outline-2 [...]" src="@/assets/imgs/avatar.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">
```

Change the `src="@/assets/imgs/avatar.jpg"` by the name of your picture.

_For example, if my picture is called `sunflower.png` I'll have to write `src="@/assets/imgs/sunflower.png"`_

## Add your work

Go to `src/components/Portfolio_Grid_Showcase.vue`.

A sample code is present from line `21` to `48`.

In order to add your work, you just have to copy the following lines and paste them after those already present.

```
{
  title: "Write the name of your project",
  img: "yourimage.jpg",
  url: "Enter the URL of your project, if there are none, leave the quotation marks blank",
},
```

**The images of your projects must be square.** _For exemple: 1000 x 1000, 2500 x 2500, 5000 x 5000, ..._

**The extension of your images is free. Please consider that for this project I have chosen to provide images in .jpg but the .webp extension will be more suitable for the web.**
